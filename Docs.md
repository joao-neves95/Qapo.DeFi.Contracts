## Vision, mission

- Qapo believes on the long term evolution of DeFi, which will turn into the new financial system.
- The system will start by being an yield optimizer. The objective is to provide its users with the most amount of value, with long term sustainability in mind.
- Big efforts will go into stablecoin strategy investments, as stated above, we believe that DeFi should be the base long term portfolio of an investor
- There will also be products with risk, to serve those investor profiles and to provide risk diversification.
- With time there will be created new types of protocols that will take part on the future of DeFi, the new financial system standard.

## Deposits and Withdraws

- Users can deposit and withdraw multiple white listed ERC20 tokens, so they do not need to sell their assets in order to enter a vault.
- It is possible to give ownership of an account to another address. This action is permanent/irreversible.

## Fees

- 0% deposit fee on Qapo.
- Withdrawal fee from Qapo, counting from the last deposit, that reduces after time, as follows:
  - 4% for the first 5 days.
  - 2% for the first 10 days.
  - 0.5% for the first 20 days.
  - 0.15% for the first 30 days.
