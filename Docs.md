## Vision, mission

- Qapo was made to automate and optimize DeFi farming.
- The initial intent is to deploy strategies for inflationary and/or ponzi-like farms. These have high returns in mind.
- In the future there will be created new products with a long term vision. Their function will be to provide the user the basis for his portfolio, smothing its volatility and generate consistent growth.

## Deposits and Withdraws

- In addition to the underlying assets, users can deposit and withdraw multiple whitelisted ERC20 tokens, so they do not need to sell their assets in order to enter or exit a vault.
- It is possible to give ownership of an account to another address. This action is permanent/irreversible.

## Fees

- 0% deposit fee on Qapo.
- Withdrawal fee from Qapo, counting from the last deposit, that reduces after time, as follows:
  - 4% for the first 5 days.
  - 1% for the first 10 days.
  - 0.5% for the first 20 days.
  - 0.1% for the first 30 days.
  - 0% after 30 days (31st day).
- 10% performance fee on rewards. This is to pay for things like network gas fees, servers, development, domain names, etc.
