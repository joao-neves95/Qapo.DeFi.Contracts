## Vision, mission

- Qapo believes on the long term evolution of DeFi, which will turn into the new financial system.
- The system will start by being an yield optimizer. The objective is to provide its users with the most amount of value, with long term sustainability in mind.
- Big efforts will go into stablecoin strategy investments, as stated above, we believe that DeFi should be the base long term portfolio of an investor
- There will also be products with risk, to serve those investor profiles and to provide risk diversification.
- With time there will be created new types of protocols that will take part on the future of DeFi, the new financial system standard.

## Withdraws

- In order to have a system capable of being deployed cross-chain, by lowering blockchain computing gas fees, there doesn't exist partial withdraws.
- The user must perform the complete withdraw of principal and interest earned.
- It is possible to give ownership of an account to another address. This action is permanent/irreversible.

## Fees

- 0% deposit fee on Qapo.
- Withdraw fee from Qapo, counting from the last deposit, that reduces after time like follows:
  - 4% for the first 5 days.
  - 1% for the first 10 days.
  - 0.5% for the first 20 days.
  - 0.25% for the first 30 days.
  - 0% after 30 days (31st day).
- 10% performance fee on rewards. This is to pay for things like gas, servers, development, domain names, etc.
